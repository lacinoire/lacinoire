### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 Came here because of a PR I openend on your repository?

  I’m currently working on research study on improving test suites of open source projects.
  We manually create and review each pull request and only propose tests that we believe are useful for a project.
  If you want to help us, please give us your detailed opinion on the test case and the PR description in the comments!
  If are interested in receiving more tests, please mention this in a comment on the PR 🙂
  

- 👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently working as a PhD Student @ the Software Engineering Research Group of TU Delft. I'm looking into how developers interact with automatic test generation tools and how we can build tools that bring truly useful tests to them 😊
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to custom keyboard layouts, test generation and the software engineering research world 🌍️
